                    Introducing asynchronous JavaScript mdn web notes

What is asynchronous programming?
It is a technique that allows a program to start a task that might take long to run but can still respond to other events while running the task without waiting for the long task to finish. 

Examples
Functions in browsers:
        " * Making HTTP requests using fetch().
          * Accessing a user's camera or microphone using getUserMedia().
          * Asking a user to select files using showOpenFilePicker()."

What is synchronous programming?
The program is run in the order it was written one line at a time and waits for a line to finish running before moving to the next line. So, each line depends on the work done by the previous line.

What can asynchronous functions do?
      "1. Start a long-running operation by calling a function.
      2. Have that function start the operation and return immediately, so...[the] program can still be responsive to other events.
      3. Notify us with the result of the operation when it eventually completes"'

How are asynchronous functions implemented in JavaScript?
Event handlers
An example : XMLHttpRequest (XHR)
In asynchronous functions the event is not a user action (clicking button), but a "change in state of some object".
Event handler: is a callback function.
callback function: a function passed into another function
Modern asynchronous APIs don't use callbacks because callbacks are called inside callbacks and are very nested resulting in difficulty to handle errors making it hard to read and debug. It is known as the "callback hell"/"pyramid of doom"

The Promise: "the foundation of asynchronous programming"
